# android-kotlin-sample

Sample Android project inspired by Google's architecture blueprints, using a mock shopping cart API service as my "remote data source".  This app, lazily called "Shopper", is an Instacart-like app that gives the user the ability to add grocery items to a cart and checkout.  The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate profiency Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Components and not to be taken too seriously, haha.  Lots of fun libraries including:

* Navigation
* MVVM
* coroutines
* Compose
* Paging3
* Mockk
* Espresso

## Getting Started

 * Clone this repository `https://github.com/lmorda/android-kotlin-sample`
 * Open the Project with Android Studio
 * Run the app
